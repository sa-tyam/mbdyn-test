a constitutive law module


I created a module named module-gsoc-satyam. 

Constitutive law 
elastic modulus (E) = 2 x rigidity modulus (G) x ( 1 + poisson's ratio (Mu) )

is used in this module.

In order to complete this module, I took references from the modules module-constlaw, module-contcontact, module-hunt-crossley and module-muscles.

A sample input file is provided in the folder. We can change the data and see the result changing.
I have tested the input files for three caes, changing the values of rigidity modulud and poisson's ration in each case. The output change can be seen in the screenshots available in the folder.
